## Instalation

```
yarn
```

run tests
```
yarn test
```

Not many assumptions, I'm returning `{data:[]}` or error code `{code: number}`. For scenario with invalid acc number, In addidions there is message `{code: number, message: string}`

I'm using jsDoc, It's providing very basic type checking and hints in IDE.

I've tok spec from javascript-vanilla.md spec and solve them case by case. TDD FTW
