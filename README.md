# Tech Tests

There are two tests here:
* javascript-vanilla.md
* react-raw.md

The idea is to see what you know, so please do not spend more than 1.5 hours on each part. This should be enough time for you to build each app to the best of your ability, using the styles that come most naturally to you.

Of course feel free to google wherever you need prompts for something you don't remember off hand, but if you are hunting around stack overflow for a solution, you are likely digging too deep and would be better addressing the areas of the test you know better.

**DO NOT EXPECT TO FINISH** There is deliberately more work than you can likely achieve in 3 hours, this is to help you feel more comfortable with submitting an incomplete solution.

Please lightly annotate your code with comments, especially where you don't have time to implement a feature, short one liners will suffice. We are interested in your intent and approach so something like the following will suffice:

```js
// TODO: cache response from api
code...
```

Remember to include README's with each solution so we can run your solution.
